My 2nd day using Git and GitHub.

1) Understood how to push a local repository to a remote repository using git.
   
   Commands: 1) git remote add origin linkOfYourRepository (adds local to remote repository)
             2) git push -u origin master (adds from local to master branch) 

2) .gitignore : a command that avoids adding sensative files to the repository. 

3) Cloning : A way to pull down all the commits and all of the versions of a particular remote repository and to store the files inside the working directory. 

4) Branching & Merging : 

   Commands for Branching : 1) git branch New_Branch   (To create a new branch) 
                            2) git branch   (To see all the branches present)
                            3) git checkout New_Branch  (To switch to a different branch) 
                            4) git add .        
                            5) git commit -m "New changes" 
    
    Commands for Merging : 1) git checkout master    (Change to master branch)
                           2) git merge New_Branch   
                           3) git push 
   
   
   5) Forking : Creating a copy of someone else's directory into your own github account.
   6) Pull Requests: Merging the commits someone made in your project by forking.
